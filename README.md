### Ecological data used:
Data on first emergences of *Pieris rapae* were obtained from Figure 3 in **Gordo, O., and J. J. Sanz. 2006**. Temporal trends in phenology of the honey bee *Apis mellifera* (L.) and the small white *Pieris rapae* (L.) in the Iberian Peninsula (1952-2004). *Ecological Entomology* 31:261–268 [DOI:10.1111/j.1365-2311.2006.00787.x](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2006.00787.x). Digitalized using [WebPlotDigitizer](https://github.com/ankitrohatgi/WebPlotDigitizer).

Data on development rate of *Pieris rapae* pupae across temperatures were obtained from **Gilbert, N. 1988**. Control of fecundity in pieris rapae. V. Comparisons between populations. *Journal of Animal Ecology* 57:395–410. [DOI:10.2307/4913](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4913).
